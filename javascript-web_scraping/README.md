# JavaScript - Web Scraping
This repository provides an introduction to web scraping with JavaScript programming language. It covers various topics including how to retrieve data from a website using web scraping techniques, how to parse HTML content and manipulate JSON data, and how to use request and fetch API to communicate with external sources.

### Why JavaScript programming is amazing
JavaScript is a versatile programming language that can be used for both front-end and back-end development. It is widely used for web development and provides developers with a powerful set of tools to create dynamic and interactive web applications. Some of the key features of JavaScript include:

- Ease of use: JavaScript is a very beginner-friendly language, which makes it easy to learn and use. It has a simple syntax and a flexible set of rules, making it accessible to developers of all skill levels.
- Flexibility: JavaScript can be used for a variety of purposes, including front-end and back-end development, scripting, and web scraping.
- Popularity: JavaScript is one of the most popular programming languages in the world, with a large and active community of developers. This means that there are plenty of resources and support available for JavaScript developers.
- Compatibility: JavaScript is supported by all major web browsers, making it easy to create web applications that work across multiple platforms.
### How to manipulate JSON data
JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight data interchange format that is widely used for data exchange between web applications. It is a text-based format that is easy to read and write, and can be parsed and generated using JavaScript. This repository provides examples of how to manipulate JSON data using JavaScript, including how to:

- Read and parse JSON data from a file or a URL
- Create and modify JSON data using JavaScript objects and arrays
- Convert JSON data to a string and vice versa
### How to use request and fetch API
The request and fetch APIs are used to communicate with external sources, such as web servers or APIs. These APIs allow you to send HTTP requests and receive responses in a variety of formats, including JSON, XML, and HTML. This repository provides examples of how to use these APIs in JavaScript, including how to:

- Send GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE requests using the request and fetch APIs
- Handle HTTP responses and errors
- Set headers and query parameters

How to read and write a file using fs module
The fs module in Node.js provides an easy way to read and write files using JavaScript. This repository provides examples of how to use the fs module to read and write files in different formats, including text, JSON, and binary data. Some of the topics covered include:

- Reading and writing text files using fs.readFile() and fs.writeFile()
- Reading and writing JSON files using JSON.stringify() and JSON.parse()
- Reading and writing binary files using fs.readFileSync() and fs.writeFileSync()
